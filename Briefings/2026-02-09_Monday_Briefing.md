## 💰 Financial Summary

## 🔍 Audit & Suggestions
* **Bottleneck:** Client payment for 'Project Alpha' received, but no new tasks in `Needs_Action` for next week.
* **Proactive Suggestion:** "I noticed we spent $20 on Netflix from the business account. Should I flag this as a personal expense?"

## 📅 Next Steps
1. [ ] Find new leads to hit the $5k target.
